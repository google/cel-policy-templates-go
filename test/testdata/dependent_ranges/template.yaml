    Ranges may depend on prior ranges as input arguments within the 'in'
    expression. In the example below, the values in 'i' are multiplied
    to produce the values for j. The result should be:
      [2, 3, 6], [3, 2, 6]

  ranges:
    - {value: i, in: "[1, 2, 3]"}
    - {index: idx, value: j, in: "[i, i * 2, i * 3]"}
  productions:
    - match: j % 6 == 0
      decision: policy.report
      output: >
        [i, idx + 1, j]
