    Multiple ranges form a cross product. In the example, the
    pattern 'a', 'b', 'c' is emitted unless the index of the
    letter is equal to the index value in the outer range:
        /  b  c
        a  /  c
        a  b  /

  ranges:
    - value: idx
      in: >
        [0, 1, 2]
    - index: letterIdx
      value: letter
      in: >
        ["a", "b", "c"]
  productions:
    - match: idx != letterIdx
      decision: policy.report
      output: letter
